93 down, 5 to go.  John Siracusa annouced that he will end his
[Hypercritical](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical) podcast after episode
100.  As the unoffical sabermetrician of Siracusa Country, I have to
ask the question, "How much time do we have before the end of
Hypercritial?"  Here's the data:

{% img /images/hypercritical_remaining_episode_length.png Plot of episode lengths %}

The easiest way is just to take the average of all the episode lengths
(96.3 minutes, excluding the very short episode 54 and the
Kindacritial episode 79) and multiply it by the 5 remaining episodes.
That gives an estimate of 481.7 minutes.

But what is the most likely episode length?  A cumulative distribution will show the data
more clearly:

Here we can see that most common episode length was 102 minutes, which
occured 6 times. So the most likely remaining length is 510 minutes (5
times 102).  Use that estimate for your office pool, where the closest
guess wins the
[toaster](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00357YS3A/) and
everyone else gets nothing.
