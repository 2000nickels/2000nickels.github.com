    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>93 down, 5 to go.  John Siracusa annouced that he will end his
<a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a> podcast after episode
100.  As the unoffical sabermetrician of Siracusa Country, I have to
ask the question, &#8220;How much time do we have before the end of
Hypercritial?&#8221;  Here&#8217;s the data:</p>

<p><img src="http://2000nickels.github.com/images/hypercritical_remaining_episode_length.png" title="Plot of episode lengths" ></p>

<p>The easiest way is just to take the average of all the episode lengths
(96.3 minutes, excluding the very short episode 54 and the
Kindacritial episode 79) and multiply it by the 5 remaining episodes.
That gives an estimate of 481.7 minutes.</p>

<p>But what is the most likely episode length?  A cumulative distribution will show the data
more clearly:</p>

<p><img src="http://2000nickels.github.com/images/hypercritical_remaining_cdf.png" title="Cumulative distribution of episode lengths" ></p>

<p>Here we can see that most common episode length was 102 minutes, which
occured 6 times. So the most likely remaining length is 510 minutes (5
times 102).  Use that estimate for your office pool, where the closest
guess wins the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00357YS3A/">toaster</a> and
everyone else gets nothing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the new Raspbian distribution has hardware accelerated floating
point operations, I wanted to test how fast the Raspberry Pi can run.
But what to use for a benchmark?  Well,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a> is the
historical choice for evaluating floating point performance.  Sure,
the Pi doesn&#8217;t come with a FORTRAN compiler, but there is a C version
of the benchmark that I got to compile with a <a href="https://github.com/2000nickels/linpackc">few minor
changes</a>.</p>

<p>Using the Raspbian Wheezy (2012-09-18) image, here are the results from linpack:</p>

<p>So that works out to be 41 MFLOPS.  Not bad for a 700 MHz processor.
But what if we do enable overclocking with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo raspi-config
</code></pre>

<p>then, under the overclocking section, choose the
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2008">Turbo</a> option:</p>

<pre><code>Turbo  1000MHz ARM, 500MHz core, 500MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolt
</code></pre>

<p>The turbo mode runs at 1000 MHz and gives the following results:</p>

<p>So, the Raspberry Pi that I bought for $35 is the number-crunching
equivalent of three Cray X-MP supercomputers.  Not bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Who knew it could be so fun to calculate statistics about the length of a podcast? Kieran Healy has made some <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/13/trying-to-rein-it-in/">beautiful plots</a>, as well as subjecting <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2012/07/17/talk-radio/">other 5by5 shows</a> to the same treatment. <a href="https://twitter.com/olihawkins">Oli Hawkins</a> did some <a href="https://twitter.com/olihawkins/status/225639768229289986">nice hypothesis testing</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>But Don Schaffner answered the question we all want to know: how long before 5by5 is <a href="http://donschaffner.tumblr.com/post/27430785897/while-2000nickels-and-kjhealy-have-crafted-elegant">running Hypercritical 24x7</a>?  By fitting a line through all the shows, he showed the answer is 371 years.</p>

<p>What about the shows just before episode 51, where John Siracusa said, &#8220;I want to try for something shorter.&#8221; If he hadn&#8217;t started to rein it in, how bad would it be?  This bad:</p>

<p><img src="http://2000nickels.github.com/images/overcompensating_singularity_Run-up.png" title="Linear fit of episodes 35-50 in the run-up to the goal." ></p>

<p>After doing a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/linear-regression-with-pylab/">linear regression</a> on episodes 35 through 50 (shown in red), we see the length is increasing at 2.75 minutes per episode.  At that rate, we reach the 5by5 singularity (Siracusarity?) at <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a> episode #3672 in a short 69 years.</p>

<p>So, John&#8217;s true goal is revealed and achieved: Hypercritical has stopped getting longer.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-08T20:49:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://2000nickels.github.com/blog/2012/07/08/hypercritical-length</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a> podcast, John Siracusa often worries his podcast is too long.  Personally, I like the long episodes, but as they say, &#8220;It&#8217;s his show.&#8221;  Let&#8217;s look at the data.</p>

<p>There are two main questions we can ask about Hypercritical&#8217;s length:</p>

<p><strong>The Goal:</strong> In <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/51">episode #51</a>, John said, &#8220;That&#8217;s my personal goal, that I want to try for something shorter.&#8221;  Are the episodes after #51 are shorter than the earlier episodes?</p>

<p><strong>The Jinx:</strong> When John says he is planning a short show, sometimes it becomes one of the  longest episodes. (At 2 hours and 14 minutes, I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/68">#68: Patent Hands</a>.)  Are the <em>short</em> shows longer than the <em>not-short</em> shows?  Does he jinx it by declaring it a short show?</p>

<h3>The Data</h3>

<p>I collected all the Hypercritical episode lengths, then I started listening to the beginning of each episode.  (Forgive me Dan, but I <em>might</em> have listened at double speed.  It was in the name of science.)  I started at episode <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/75">#75: Just a Dinosaur</a>, and worked my way back to <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/51">#51: Unjustified Confidence</a>, where John declared his goal (definitely not a New Year&#8217;s resolution) to have shorter shows.</p>

<p>Of those 25 post-goal episodes, I counted 8 where John said it was going to be a short show or his time was limited: #51, #52, #60, #68, #71, #72, #74, and #75.  These are the <em>short</em> episodes, regardless of the actual length.  That leaves 16 <em>not-short</em> episodes, ignoring #54, which was the 1 minute public service announcement for the <a href="http://5by5.tv/specials/4">Kindacritical special</a>.</p>

<p>Putting all the data together, here&#8217;s a plot of the episode lengths, colored by type: <em>pre-goal</em>, <em>short</em>, and <em>non-short</em>.  I can see by eye that the <em>post-goal</em> episodes are not shorter than the <em>pre-goal</em> episodes, but I can&#8217;t tell if the &#8220;short show&#8221; jinx is true.   Let&#8217;s dig in further.</p>

<p><img src="http://2000nickels.github.com/images/hypercritical_length_scatter_plot.png" title="Plot of episode lengths" ></p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>

<p>When we plot the cumulative distributions of the <em>pre-</em> and <em>post-goal</em> shows, it&#8217;s very obvious that the <em>post-goal</em> shows are not shorter, by any measure.  After stating his goal, John is not getting any worse (that is, the maximum length has stayed at 135 minutes), but the median episode length has increased from 85 to 106 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="http://2000nickels.github.com/images/hypercritical_length_goal_cdf.png" title="Cumulative distribution of pre- and post-goal shows" ></p>

<h3>The Jinx</h3>

<p>The interesting question is: can John jinx the show by saying it will be short?  The data here is a little more complicated.  In the cumulative distribution plot below, we can see both the <em>short</em> and the <em>not-short</em> episode lengths.  While 2 out of 3 of the longest episodes were in the <em>short</em> group, the median episode length is 7 minutes less when he calls it a &#8220;short&#8221; show.  Also, 4 of the 5 shortest episodes belong to the <em>short</em> group, and the average <em>short</em> show is 103 minutes versus 109 minutes for the <em>not-short</em> shows.  So, we can disprove the jinx; when John says it will be a short show, I&#8217;m going to bet that it will be shorter.</p>

<p><img src="http://2000nickels.github.com/images/hypercritical_length_short_cdf.png" title="Cumulative distribution of pre- and post-goal shows" ></p>

<p>Let me express my thanks to John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin for making the Hypercritical podcast.  Long or short, I look forward to it every week.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> For your analysis pleasure, I&#8217;ve put the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An2aYNMmjYsXdFZrWlhuMDJaSkJhZHVRdzZMMnlmMmc#gid=0">raw data into a Google spreadsheet</a>. That includes the episode titles, lengths and what John said to make me call it a <em>short</em> show.</p>
